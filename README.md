## Summary

Data plays an increasingly important role in managerial decision-making. Improved data availability, more computing resources, and advances in machine learning (ML) progressively enable organizations to derive insights from historical data through pattern recognition, helping them anticipate future outcomes. Analytical methods must match the decision problem and context at hand. This holds especially for applications in human resource management (HRM), where decisions impact individuals directly and legal and ethical considerations are critical.

This dissertation builds on three types of analytics: descriptive to summarize past patterns, predictive to estimate future outcomes, and prescriptive to recommend actions. Each serves a different role in decision-making and shapes the contributions in both parts of the dissertation. 

- Part I covers HR analytics applications, focusing on internal mobility, employee turnover, and internal job recommendation. The work was developed in close collaboration with Acerta, an HR services provider, through an iterative process of discussion, implementation, and validation.

- Part II presents methodological contributions that generalize beyond HRM to bring ML closer to the complexities of real-world decision-making. It introduces robust techniques for instance-dependent cost-sensitive classification, fairness-aware learning for resource allocation, and a predict-thenoptimize framework for uplift modeling with continuous treatments.

By combining applied and methodological work, the dissertation helps close the gap between technical developments and practical needs. It offers concrete tools for organizations aiming to make more informed and better decisions with data.
